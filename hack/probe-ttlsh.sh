# probe-ttlsh.sh — decide whether CI should push to ttl.sh at all.
#
# ttl.sh can keep answering reads while starting an upload hangs with no
# response, for hours; every push then sits until its job times out. Starting
# an upload is the exact call that hangs, so that is what this probes, with a
# deadline. The session it opens is never used and expires on its own.
#
# Writes publish=true|false to $GITHUB_OUTPUT; false also emits a warning
# annotation. A hang that starts after the probe is still bounded by the push
# step's own timeout.
